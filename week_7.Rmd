```{r setup, include=TRUE}
data <- rbind(matrix(rnorm(30*10, mean = 2), nrow = 30),
matrix(rnorm(30*10, mean=4), nrow = 30),
matrix(rnorm(30*10, mean=6), nrow = 30))
data.pca = prcomp(data)$x
plot(data.pca[,1:2], col=c(rep(1,30), rep(2,30), rep(3,30)))

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

2 b)

```{r setup2, include=TRUE}
km.out=kmeans(data,3,nstart =20)
km.out$cluster
true_label = c(rep(1,30), rep(2,30), rep(3,30))
table(km.out$cluster,true_label)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
The above code we performed k-means clustering with k =3 variable and we got the true and predicted labels.Then we compared both the labels and got to know that all of them are perfectly clustered .

2 c)

```{r setup1, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
km.out=kmeans(scale(data),3,nstart =20)
km.out$cluster
true_label = c(rep(1,30), rep(2,30), rep(3,30))
table(km.out$cluster,true_label)

```

The above code has performed with k cluster using scale function . The results are same as the above,Here the scaling function does not have effect on results it remains to be same . 

same as above results  ,scaling doesnot change results




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
